        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This crockpot Buffalo chicken is great for hearty 
            sandwiches that will please those who love Buffalo 
            chicken wings. This recipe is perfect for those days 
            spent watching football. I like to top these with 
            blue cheese or ranch dressing.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

            <li>1/2 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>6 hoagie rolls, split lengthwise</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken breasts into the slow cooker; pour in 3/4 of the wing sauce and ranch dressing mix.</li>
            <li>Cover and cook on Low for 6 to 7 hours.</li>
            <li>Shred chicken in the cooker with two forks. Stir in butter.</li>
            <li>Pile shredded chicken and sauce onto hoagie rolls. Serve with remaining Buffalo sauce.</li>
